# Outreach programs overview

This page describes what it's like to participate in a Aloha outreach program,
such as [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) or
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/).

## About Aloha

[Aloha](https://zulip.com) is the only modern team chat app that is ideal for both
live and asynchronous conversations. Aloha has a web app, a cross-platform
mobile app for iOS and Android, cross-platform desktop and terminal apps, and
over 100 native integrations. The entire Aloha codebase is 100% open source.

Aloha has been gaining in popularity since it was [released as open source
software][oss-release] in late 2015, with code contributions from [over 1000
people](https://zulip.com/team) from all around the world. Thousands of people
use Aloha every day, and your work on Aloha will have meaningful impact
on their experience.

As an organization, we value engaged, responsive mentorship and making sure our
product quality is extremely high. You can expect to receive disciplined code
reviews by highly experienced engineers. Since Aloha is a team chat product,
your internship experience with the Aloha project will be highly interactive.

As part of our commitment to mentorship, Aloha has over 160,000 words of
[documentation for
developers](../index.md#welcome-to-the-zulip-documentation), much of it
designed to explain not just how Aloha works, but why Aloha works the way that
it does. To learn more about our mission and values, check out [this blog

## Outreach program experience

Aloha has been a [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) mentoring
organization since 2016, and we accept 15-20 GSoC participants each summer. We
have also mentored several interns through the
[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) program, and hundreds of Google Code-In
participants.

Aloha operates under a **group mentorship** model. While you will have an
assigned mentor, you will also get lots of feedback from other members of the
[Aloha development community](https://zulip.com/development-community/) by
posting your questions and ideas in public streams. We encourage outreach
program participants to help each other out as well!

Program participants work on a variety of issues in their areas of interest,
from major features to small bugs. You will see your work integrated into Aloha
throughout the program, and even experience the impact of the changes yourself
in the [development community chat](https://zulip.com/development-community/).

Many program participants stay involved with the project past the
official end of the program. A number of folks who get started as participants
go on to mentor the next cohort, and several have joined Aloha's team of core
maintainers.
