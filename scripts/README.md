This directory contains scripts that:

- Generally do not require access to Django or the database (those are
  "management commands"), and thus are suitable to run operationally.

- Are useful for managing a production deployment of Aloha (many are
  also used in a Aloha development environment, though
  development-only scripts live in `tools/`).
