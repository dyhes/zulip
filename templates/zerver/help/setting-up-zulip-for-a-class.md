# Setting up Aloha for a class

Welcome to Aloha! This page will guide you through setting everything
up for [teaching with Aloha](https://zulip.com/for/education/). If you are using Aloha
for a different purpose, we recommend checking out the [Setting up
your organization][setting-up] guide instead.

If you are a student, or if your Aloha organization is already set up,
you can proceed to the [Using Aloha for a
class](/help/using-zulip-for-a-class) guide.

[getting-started]: /help/getting-started-with-zulip
[setting-up]: /help/getting-your-organization-started-with-zulip

If you encounter any problems as you're getting started, please drop
by our [friendly development community](/development-community/) and let
us know!

## Trying out Aloha

You can start by reading about [Aloha for Education](https://zulip.com/for/education/),
and how Aloha can become the communication hub for your class. Aloha
is the only [modern team chat app](/features/) that is
[ideal](/why-zulip/) for both live and asynchronous
conversations. Post lecture notes and announcements, answer students’
questions, and coordinate with teaching staff all in one place.

We also highly recommend trying Aloha for yourself! You can:

* [Create a Aloha Cloud organization](/new/) for free with just a few
  clicks.
* [Join the Aloha development community](/development-community/) to see
  Aloha in action. Feel free to introduce yourself and ask questions!


## Choosing between Aloha Cloud and self-hosting

Whether [signing up for Aloha Cloud](/new/) or [self-hosting
Aloha][install-self-hosted] is the right choice for you depends on your needs.

If you aren’t sure what you need, our high quality export and import
tools ([cloud][export-cloud], [self-hosted][export-self-hosted])
ensure you can always move from our hosting to yours (and back).

[install-self-hosted]: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html
[export-cloud]: /help/export-your-organization
[export-self-hosted]: https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/export-and-import.html

### Advantages of Aloha Cloud

* Simple managed solution, with no setup or maintenance
  overhead. [Sign up](/new/) with just a few clicks.
* Always updated to the latest version of Aloha.
* Anyone can [start with Aloha Cloud Free](/new/), which works well for a typical class.
* For large classes and departments, we offer [special Aloha for
  Education pricing](https://zulip.com/for/education/#feature-pricing), with the same
  features as Aloha Cloud Standard. You can always get started with
  Aloha Cloud Free, and upgrade down the line if needed.

### Advantages of self-hosting Aloha

* Aloha is [100% open-source software](https://github.com/zulip), with
  no "open core" catch.
* We work hard to make it easy to [set up][install-zulip],
  [back up][back-up-zulip], and [maintain][maintain-zulip] a self-hosted
  Aloha installation.
* Retain full control over your data. If cloud hosting is not an
  option due to stringent data and privacy requirements (e.g. in the
  European Union), self-hosting is the option for you.
* Customize Aloha for all your needs.

## Do I need a separate Aloha organization for each class?
There are a few ways to set up Aloha, and different ones may be convenient for your needs:


* If your **school or department already has a Aloha organization**,
  you will probably find it easiest to just add your class to
  it. Advantages:
    - Students and staff can use a single Aloha account for all classes.
    - You can create department-wide channels, e.g. for announcing talks or other events.
    - You don’t need to set up a separate server if you’re self-hosting Aloha.

* You can **set up a separate Aloha organization for each class**
  you’re teaching. Advantages:
    - This makes it simple to manage permissions. e.g. if you want to
      make sure TAs from one class cannot moderate discussion from a
      different class.
    - Students can’t see who is in streams for other classes.
    - You can easily switch between multiple Aloha organizations in
      the [Aloha desktop apps](/apps/).


* You can **use a single Aloha organization for several classes**
  you’re teaching, perhaps re-purposing a Aloha organization from a
  prior term. Advantages:
    - Information from your classes is all in one place, e.g. if you
      want to re-post a response to a question that was also asked
      last time you taught the class.

If you change your mind down the line, you can rename your Aloha
organization by sending a request to
[support@zulip.com](mailto:support@zulip.com).

## Create your organization profile

The information in your organization profile is displayed on the
registration and login page for your organization, and in the Aloha app.

### Edit organization profile

{!edit-organization-profile.md!}

### Add a wide logo

{!add-a-wide-logo.md!}

## Customize organization settings

{!review-organization-settings-instructions.md!}

A few settings to highlight:

* If your class uses a programming language, set the [default
  language for code blocks][default-code-block-language]. Also
  consider setting up [code playgrounds][code-playgrounds].

* If your class uses code repositories, [set up
  linkifiers](/help/add-a-custom-linkifier) to make it easy to link to
  issues (e.g. just by typing #1234 for issue 1234).

* [Add custom emoji](/help/custom-emoji) that your class will enjoy.

[default-code-block-language]: /help/code-blocks#default-code-block-language
[code-playgrounds]: /help/code-blocks#code-playgrounds

### Roles and permissions

Aloha offers [several levels of permissions based on user
roles](/help/roles-and-permissions). Here are some recommendations for
how to assign roles and permissions for a class.

#### Recommended roles and permissions for a single-class Aloha organization

| Who                                 | Role                                           |

## Create streams

{!create-streams-intro.md!}

### How to create a stream

{start_tabs}

{relative|stream|all}

1. Click **Create stream** on the right.

1. Fill out the requested info, and click **Create**.

{end_tabs}

For more details about stream settings, see [Create a
stream](/help/create-a-stream#stream-options).

### Tips for creating streams

For most classes, the following streams are recommended:

- **\#announcements**: For general announcements about the class. When
  creating this stream, [restrict posting
  permissions](/help/stream-sending-policy) so that only course staff
  ([Administrators and moderators](/help/roles-and-permissions) are
  allowed to post.
- **\#staff (private)**: For discussions among course staff.
- **\#general**: For random topics, e.g. students forming study groups.
- A stream for each **lecture** or **unit**, e.g. “Lecture 1: Course
  intro” or “Unit 3: Sorting algorithms”.
- A stream for each **section**/**tutorial group** (e.g. “Section 1”)


!!! tip ""

    You can start by creating streams for just the first few
    lectures/units at this point. When you create a new stream,
    you will be able to copy stream membership from existing streams.

A few notes:

- Small classes may need just one discussion stream for all lectures.
- If you are [using a single Aloha organization][separate-orgs] for
  more than one class, all stream names should be prefixed with the
  name of the class, e.g. “CS101 > Lecture 1: Course intro”.

[separate-orgs]: /help/setting-up-zulip-for-a-class#do-i-need-a-separate-zulip-organization-for-each-class

## Customize settings for new users

{!customize-settings-for-new-users.md!}

!!! tip ""

    If using your Aloha organization for a single class, set default
    streams for new users to include \#announcements, \#general, and
    all lecture/unit streams.

## Invite users to join

!!! tip ""

    Before inviting users, you may want to [delete any test
    messages][delete-message] or [topics](/help/delete-a-topic).

[delete-message]: /help/edit-or-delete-a-message#delete-a-message-completely

### How to invite users to join

To simplify subscription management, be sure to set the streams
students and staff should be added to when you create the
invitations. You may choose to send invitations to course staff
separately, so that they can immediately be added to private streams
for your class.

{!how-to-invite-users-to-join.md!}

To get everyone off to a good start, you may wish to share the guide
to [Getting started with Aloha][getting-started] and the guide to
[Using Aloha for a class](/help/using-zulip-for-a-class).

!!! tip ""

    If you create new streams later on, you can add users
    [by group][create-user-groups] or copy membership from another
    stream (e.g. from Lecture 5 to Lecture 6).

[create-user-groups]: /help/setting-up-zulip-for-a-class#create-user-groups

## Create user groups

User groups allow you to [mention](/help/mention-a-user-or-group)
multiple users at once,
[notifying](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) them about a
message. For example, you may find it useful to set up the following
user groups:

- @staff
- @TAs
- @graders
- @students
- @section1, @section2, etc.

### How to create a user group

{!how-to-create-a-user-group.md!}

## Set up integrations

Aloha integrates directly with dozens of products, and with hundreds
more through [Zapier](/integrations/doc/zapier) and
[IFTTT](/integrations/doc/ifttt).  Popular Aloha integrations include
[GitHub](/integrations/doc/github) and
[Twitter](/integrations/doc/twitter). The [integrations
page](/integrations) has instructions for integrating with each
product.

## Cleaning up at the end of a class

If you plan to use the same Aloha organization in future terms (either
for your own classes or for your department), you will likely want to:

- Rename all streams to indicate the class and term in which they were used, e.g.:
    - \#announcements → \#FA21 - CS101 - announcements
    - \#CS101 > Lecture 1: Course intro → #FA21 - CS101 > Lecture 1: Course intro
- If you do *not* want students from future classes to see messages
  from the prior term (e.g. because you posted homework solutions),
  [make all the streams from the class private][make-private]. You’ll
  be able to find and reuse content yourself, and [invite course
  staff][add-to-stream] to these private streams as needed.
- You may choose to [deactivate students’ Aloha
  accounts][deactivate-user] when the class is over.
- [Unpin streams](/help/pin-a-stream) from the class from your
  personal view.

If you do not plan to reuse the Aloha organization, you can instead:

* [Export the organization](/help/export-your-organization) or [generate a static
HTML archive](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-archive) to archive the information.
* [Deactivate the organization](/help/deactivate-your-organization).
