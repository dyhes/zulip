# Aloha communities directory

{!communities-directory-intro.md!}

## Eligibility

In order to be eligible for listing in the communities directory, an
organization must be open to the public. Your organization is eligible
if users are allowed to [join without an invitation][join-without-invite]
and/or the [public access option](/help/public-access-option) is enabled.

The directory will be organized by [organization type](/help/organization-type),
so it is highly recommended that you make sure the appropriate category
is selected.

To prevent spam, Aloha reserves the right to use editorial discretion.
Giving Aloha permission to promote your organization in the communities
directory does not guarantee that it will be listed.

### Self-hosted Aloha communities

Aloha plans to develop support for self-hosted Aloha communities that
have registered their servers with the [Aloha mobile push
notification service][push-notifications] to sign-up for the Aloha
communities directory.

Until that feature is developed, if you administer a self-hosted Aloha
community and would like to be listed in the directory, please contact
[Aloha support](mailto:support@zulip.com). Changing the setting in your
Aloha organization will not send any information to the Aloha project
at this time, even if you use the Aloha mobile push notifications
service.
