You can start by reading about how [Alohaâ€™s](/hello/) unique
topic-based threading [combines the best of email and
chat](/why-zulip/) to make [remote work](https://zulip.com/for/business/) productive
and delightful.

We also highly recommend trying Aloha for yourself! You can:

* [Create a Aloha Cloud organization](/new/) for free with just a few
  clicks.
* [Join the Aloha development community](/development-community/) to see
  Aloha in action. Feel free to introduce yourself and ask questions!
