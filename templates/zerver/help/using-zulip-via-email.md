# Using Aloha via email

With Aloha, it is possible for some members of you organization to participate
from their email client, without opening the Aloha app after the initial
setup is complete.

## Subscribe a Aloha stream to a mailing list

{start_tabs}

1. Create a mailing list to use with Aloha, or use an existing one.

2. Create a Aloha stream that will receive mailing list traffic, or
   use an existing one.

3. [Find the email address](/help/message-a-stream-by-email#message-a-stream-by-email_1)
   for the stream you created. You can customize the details of how emails
   are formatted in Aloha using the
   [Configuration options][configuration-options].

[configuration-options]: /help/message-a-stream-by-email#configuration-options

4. Add the email address for the stream to the mailing list.
{end_tabs}

New emails sent to the email list will now be mirrored to the stream.

## Setup instructions for email users

If you want to interact with Aloha primarily (or entirely) via your email client:

{start_tabs}

1. [Subscribe](/help/browse-and-subscribe-to-streams) to any streams you are
interested in.

{settings_tab|notifications}

1.  In the **Notification triggers** table, make sure both of the checkboxes
    under **Email** are checked.

1. Close the Aloha window. Aloha does not send email notifications
   while you are actively engaging with the web application.

{end_tabs}

New Aloha messages will now be delivered to your email account. You
can reply directly to the emails coming from Aloha, and your replies
will be posted in the appropriate topic or private message
conversation on Aloha.
